What follows is a point by point response to each of the issues raised by Reviewer #1:

The reveiwer had 6 major issues with the manuscript which we address in the revision.

1a) Authors must indicate the rational for the design choice to time multiplex several PMT signals into a single digitizer channel
RESPONSE: We now include this rational in our discussion.  The digitizers are expensive and it is not important to digitize each PMT channel in high fidelity; it suffices to have 8 channels multiplexed together. 

1b) Authors must identify the potential downsides of the time multiplex approach
RESPONSE: We now identify a number of potential downsides to this time multiplexing approach.  In the delay lines section we address how this approach is affected by attenuation in the delay lines, constructave interference from dark counts and after-pulsing, and an inability to discern multiple hits.

1c) Authors must address how PMT non-idealities (e.g., dark counts and after pulsing) will contribute to the difficulty in interperting data from this time multiplexed system.
RESPONSE: We now go into detail in the Delay Lines section about how the non-idealities and problems identified in 1b will affect the system.  In short; because the system asserts the veto at a low threshold and because the event rate is so low, most of these effects will not be a problem in operation.
TODO: I use the phrase "veto signal" in a few sections.  Make sure this is consistent with other modifications.

2a) Authors must address how attenuation of PMT signals due to the delay lines complicates the analysis
2b) Authors are encouraged to show the response of the system with real PMTs

3) Authors should clarify how the veto signal is used by the system

4) Authors should make several of the figures easier to interpert
RESPONSE: Figures are now in greyscale so that there will be no loss of information when published in color vs. greyscale.
TODO: add interpertation

5) Authors must explain figure 2 in better detail and explain the choice of 0.25pe as a threshold w.r.t. this figure

6) Authors must explain how gain matching on the PMTs takes place
RESPONSE: A detail was left out of the manuscript which mitigates this issue.  The 8 PMTs attached
to each amplifier discriminator card are characterized before being grouped to a single amplifier
discriminator card and thus the variation in threshold in terms of p.e. is not large.
TODO:what is the varaition in threshold in p.e.?

The reviewer had 3 minor issues with the manuscript which we address in the revision.

1) General style is poor and should be refined.

2) Authors should address the system response to gammas and neutrons

3) Authors should use a greator-than-or-equal-to symbol for the N-hit requirement
