Thank you very much for the review.  What follows is a point by point response to each of the issues raised by Reviewer #1:

The reviewer had 4 issues with the manuscript which we address in the revision.

Issue 1) The authors should check all units for proper notation.  For example, in Figs. 6 and 7, "nS" should be replaced by "ns" and "mv" should be replaced by "mV".  There should also be a space between the number and the unit.  For example, in Fig. 6, "120mV" should be "120 mV".

RESPONSE: All units have been checked for proper notation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue 2) The authors should carefully reread their text.  In Section 3, the authors write "So, the veto electronics ..."  I do not believe that "So" should be used in the literature.  The authors leave words like "the" away in many sentences.  For example, in the caption of Fig. 6, "Horizontal scale is 50 ns ..." should read "The horizontal scale is 50 ns ...."  In Section 3, ".... prediction from simulation." should be ".... prediction from simulations."  There are many other examples where the language needs to be polished.  Many sentences are also too long and contain to much content.  For example, on page 11, line 275 - 279, one sentence should define after pulsing and one sentence should define the requirement.  On page 8, line 175 - 178, one sentence should refer to the where the module is described in detail and one sentence should focus on its operation.

RESPONSE: All uses of the word "So" have been scrubbed from the manuscript.  The manuscript has been scrubbed for missing articles and other inconsistencies.  Many run-on sentences have been re-arranged to be more easily understood.  For example, line 257 to 279 is now:

"The fraction of afterpulses in the SNO R1408 PMTs
(of which these veto PMTs are a subset) is required to be $<$1.5\% of
the total measured charge above a threshold of 0.25 p.e.  Here
afterpulses are defined as occurring at times $>$20~ns after a prompt
single p.e. calibration signal~\cite{ref:sno_pmt_paper}."

and line 175 to 178 has been significantly re-worded and is described below under issue 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue 3) The authors should check the tense of their article.  It needs to be consistent.  In many places, past and current tense are mixed.

RESPONSE:  We have scrubbed our manuscript for incorrect tense.  Now results and description of how our detector works are in the present tense.  Testing procedures or methods are generally presented in the past tense.

Issue 4) The "trigger" module reference is a thesis which is not easily accessible to most readers.  I thus feel it deserves a bit more attention than the authors give it.  Specifically, I like to know what the input requirements are.  I assume it does not require a NIM signal since otherwise the N_hit sum signal would not be able to trigger it (or it would only trigger for large multiplicity signals).

RESPONSE: This section has been re-worded to describe what the input requirements are for the "trigger" module:

"The instantaneous N-Hit sum signal across the veto is sent to a
discriminator module, which generates a NIM output pulse.  The N-Hit
threshold for the veto trigger is determined by the discriminator
level setting.  The NIM output pulse is sent to the MiniCLEAN trigger
module to form the veto trigger signal.  This module is described in
detail in~\cite{ref:gastler_thesis}.  Briefly, it accepts analog
trigger signals from a variety of inputs, constructs a trigger mask to
record which triggers are active at each timestamp, and fans the master
trigger signal out to the digitizer boards to cause acquisition of a
waveform from all channels, forming an event.  Given the low expected
rate of muons traversing the veto, the veto trigger signal is used to
cause data acquisition across the full detector rather than to prevent
the DAQ from recording data when a veto signal is present."
