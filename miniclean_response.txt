What follows is a point by point response to each of the issues raised by Reviewer #1:

The reveiwer had 6 major issues with the manuscript which we address in the revision.

1a) Authors must indicate the rational for the design choice to time multiplex several PMT signals into a single digitizer channel
RESPONSE: We now include this rational in our discussion.  The digitizers are expensive and it is not important to digitize each PMT channel in high fidelity; it suffices to have 8 channels multiplexed together. 

1b) Authors must identify the potential downsides of the time multiplex approach
RESPONSE: We now identify a number of potential downsides to this time multiplexing approach.  In the delay lines section we address how this approach is affected by attenuation in the delay lines, constructave interference from dark counts and after-pulsing, and an inability to discern multiple hits.

1c) Authors must address how PMT non-idealities (e.g., dark counts and after pulsing) will contribute to the difficulty in interperting data from this time multiplexed system.
RESPONSE: We now go into detail in the Delay Lines section about how the non-idealities and problems identified in 1b will affect the system.  In short; because the system asserts the veto at a low threshold and because the event rate is so low, most of these effects will not be a problem in operation.
TODO: I use the phrase "veto signal" in a few sections.  Make sure this is consistent with other modifications.

2a) Authors must address how attenuation of PMT signals due to the delay lines complicates the analysis
2b) Authors are encouraged to show the response of the system with real PMTs
--JRM: can you show data from the fake-MiniCLEAN tests that were done at BU?

3) Authors should clarify how the veto signal is used by the system
--JRM RESPONSE:  A paragraph was added to section 3 on how the veto signal is used as a trigger.

4) Authors should make several of the figures easier to interpert
RESPONSE: Figures are now in greyscale so that there will be no loss of information when published in color vs. greyscale.
TODO: add interpertation

5) Authors must explain figure 2 in better detail and explain the
choice of 0.25pe as a threshold w.r.t. this figure 

-JRM RESPONSE: Section 2.1 has been substantially rewritten, and
figure 2 removed.  The primary testing of the veto PMTs to determine
operating voltage, efficiency, single PE charge, and noise rates was
done by the SNO experiment, and a reference to the technical
publication documenting this has been added. The testing described
here was done following the SNO procedure to verify that the PMTs were
still working, and to select the subset of PMTs to use in the veto.
The resulting single PE charges and noise rates were consistent
with the SNO measurements, and so the SNO values are used.  This is
now clarified in the text in the first two paragraphs of Section 2.1.

Regarding the 3 mV threshold, the following sentences have been added
to Section 2.1 paragraph 2 to clarify this: 
"We required the rate of pulses with $>$3~mV (approximately 0.25~p.e.)
to be less than 3000~Hz in the absence of a light source.  This
threshold is motivated by the Monte Carlo study which determined that
for an N-Hit threshold of 0.25~p.e. and a coincidence level of N-Hit
$\ge$ 2, the predicted efficiency is 0.999.  The selected PMTs have a
mean single p.e. charge of 1.37 $\pm$0.17 pC, therefore
0.25~p.e. corresponds approximately to 3~mV."

6) Authors must explain how gain matching on the PMTs takes place
--JRM RESPONSE: This has been clarified in a sentence in Section 2.1,
paragraph 2: "PMTs were then grouped by 8, choosing operating voltages
within $\pm$15V per group, in order to gain match the PMTs that are
multiplexed in the veto electronics.  "

RESPONSE: A detail was left out of the manuscript which mitigates this issue.  The 8 PMTs attached
to each amplifier discriminator card are characterized before being grouped to a single amplifier
discriminator card and thus the variation in threshold in terms of p.e. is not large.
TODO:what is the varaition in threshold in p.e.?

The reviewer had 3 minor issues with the manuscript which we address in the revision.

1) General style is poor and should be refined.

2) Authors should address the system response to gammas and neutrons

--JRM RESPONSE: the veto operates by detecting Cherenkov light, and
  therefore does not have direct sensitivity to gammas and neutrons.
  The water attenuates gammas and neutrons significantly, this is now
  stated explicitly in Section 2, par. 1, sentence 2, and the
  last sentence of Section 2, par. 1 addresses the resulting
  cosmogenic muon, and associated neutron and gamma, -induced recoil
  background.

  

3) Authors should use a greator-than-or-equal-to symbol for the N-hit requirement
--JRM RESPONSE: Done. NHit > 2 has been changed to N-Hit >= 3 throughout.
